# Image Denoising Diffusion Models: A School Assignment

Two types of deep learning models able to denoise images iteratively

1. **DDPM (Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Model)**
  - Noise is iteratively added to images until they appear indistinguishable from pure Gaussian noise.
  - The model then learns to do the reverse - denoise images until they are legible.
  

2. **DDIM (Diffusion Denoising Implicit Model)**
  - Solves the problem of long training time taken by DDPM from needing thousands of model passes to generate one image.
  - With a quality tradeoff, allows for some of the image denoising steps to be skipped.
